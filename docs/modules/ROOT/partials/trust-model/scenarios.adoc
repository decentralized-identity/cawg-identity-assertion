=== Trust scenarios in identity assertion

The `signature` in an *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* could be considered as a new credential documenting the relationship between _<<_named_actor,named actor>>_ and _<<C2PA asset>>,_ which will be referred to in this section as an _asset-specific credential._

IMPORTANT: “Content Credential” is a trademarked term that refers to _<<_c2pa_manifest,C2PA Manifests>>_ and MUST NOT be used in reference to *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* signatures.

For each form of credential that an _<<_identity_asertion_consumer,identity assertion consumer>>_ is prepared to accept, it SHOULD maintain:

. a list of trust relationships that it is prepared to accept when interpreting any *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>,* and
. one or more mechanisms to check for credentials that have been _<<_credential_revocation,revoked>>_ by the _issuer._

There are a few possible relationships between the implementation of the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>,* _<<_named_actor,named actor>>,_ and _credential issuer,_ as documented in the following subsections.

IMPORTANT: The trust decisions described in the scenarios should only be evaluated once the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* and the signature material within have been successfully validated as described in xref:_validating_the_identity_assertion[xrefstyle=full].

The trust decision can result in one of three descriptions of the _<<_named_actor,named actor>>:_

* *Trusted:* The _<<_identity_asertion_consumer,identity assertion consumer>>_ can verify a trust relationship to the _<<_named_actor,named actor>>_ through its established roots of trust.
The _<<_identity_asertion_consumer,identity assertion consumer>>_ found no evidence that the credential was _<<_credential_revocation,revoked>>_ at the time the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* was created.
* *Well-formed:* The _<<_identity_asertion_consumer,identity assertion consumer>>_ can not verify a trust relationship to the _<<_named_actor,named actor>>._
The _<<_identity_asertion_consumer,identity assertion consumer>>_ found no evidence that the credential was _<<_credential_revocation,revoked>>_ at the time the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* was created.
* *Revoked:* The credential used for signing the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* had been _<<_credential_revocation,revoked>>_ at the time the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* was created.

==== Named actor as issuer

In this scenario, the _<<_credential_holder,credential holder>>_ possesses a credential that describes the _<<_named_actor,named actor>>_ and is provisioned with the ability to generate digital signatures on the _<<_named_actor,named actor’s>>_ behalf.

This scenario is implicit in the X.509 certificate-based workflow as described in xref:_x_509_certificates_and_cose_signatures[xrefstyle=full].
Other credential types MAY also follow this scenario.

The _<<_credential_holder,credential holder>>_ uses this signature authority directly to generate the _asset-specific credential,_ as depicted in the following diagram, which is non-normative:

.Named actor as issuer
image::trust-model/named-actor-as-issuer.drawio.svg[Named actor as issuer,width=570,height=240,align="center"]

In this scenario, the _<<_identity_assertion_consumer,identity assertion consumer>>_ SHOULD make its trust decision based on the following predicates:

. Is there a direct trust relationship with the _<<_named_actor,named actor>>?_
If so, the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* SHOULD be treated as *trusted.*
. Is there a transitive trust relationship with the _<<_named_actor,named actor>>_ via its _credential issuer?_
(In other words, does the _<<_identity_assertion_consumer,identity assertion consumer>>_ trust the _credential issuer_ to issue valid signature credentials?)
.. If so, was the _<<_named_actor,named actor’s>>_ credential _<<_credential_revocation,revoked>>_ at the time the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* was signed?
If so, the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* SHOULD be treated as *revoked.*
.. If the transitive trust relationship exists and the credential has not been _<<_credential_revocation,revoked>>,_ the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* SHOULD be treated as *trusted.*
. If neither relationship can be demonstrated, the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* SHOULD be treated as *well-formed.*

IMPORTANT: Any available information about credential _<<_credential_revocation,revocation>>_ SHOULD be included in the _<<_identity_assertion_consumer,identity assertion consumer’s>>_ report about the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* regardless of *trusted* or *untrusted* status.

NOTE: The direct trust relationship case is possible, but relatively uncommon.

==== Named actor without signature authority

In this scenario, the _<<_credential_holder,credential holder>>_ possesses a credential that describes the _<<_named_actor,named actor>>_ but does not have the ability to generate digital signatures on the _<<_named_actor,named actor’s>>_ behalf.

In this scenario, the hardware or software implementation that is generating the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* MAY request a summary of the _<<_named_actor,named actor’s>>_ credential from the _<<_credential_holder,credential holder>>,_ and gather that information into the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>,* which it will then sign using its own credentials.

.Example using W3C verifiable credentials
[sidebar]
****
This example, which is non-normative, depicts a possible workflow for this scenario.
In this scenario, the _<<_credential_holder,credential holder>>_ wishes to use a W3C verifiable credential held in a wallet to generate an *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* on behalf of the credential’s _<<_named_actor,named actor>>._

In this example, the wallet is prepared to selectively disclose portions of the credential via W3C verifiable presentation, but can neither reveal the entire credential nor issue other forms of signature.

In this scenario, the _issuer_ of the _asset-specific credential_ is not the _<<_credential_holder,credential holder>>_ but the _<<_actor,actor>>_ that is generating the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>,* as depicted in the following diagram, which is non-normative:

.Named actor without signature authority
image::trust-model/no-signature-authority.drawio.svg[Named actor without signature authority,width=570,height=320,align="center"]

In this scenario, the _<<_identity_assertion_consumer,identity assertion consumer>>_ SHOULD make its trust decision based on the following predicates:

. Does the _<<_identity_assertion_consumer,identity assertion consumer>>_ trust the _<<_identity_assertion_generator,identity assertion generator>>_ to request a credential summary from the _<<_credential_holder,credential holder>>_ and accurately reflect that credential summary into the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>?*
.. Is there a direct trust relationship with the _<<_identity_assertion_generator,identity assertion generator>>?_
If so, proceed to step 2.
.. Is there a transitive trust relationship with the _<<_identity_assertion_generator,identity assertion generator>>_ via its _credential issuer?_
(In other words, does the _<<_identity_assertion_consumer,identity assertion consumer>>_ trust the _<<_identity_assertion_generator,identity assertion generator’s>>_ _credential issuer_ to issue valid signature credentials?)
.. If so, was the _<<_identity_assertion_generator,identity assertion generator’s>>_ credential _<<_credential_revocation,revoked>>_ at the time the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* was signed?
If so, do not proceed.
The *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* SHOULD be treated as *revoked.*
.. If the transitive trust relationship exists and the credential has not been _<<_credential_revocation,revoked>>,_ proceed to step 2.
.. If neither relationship can be demonstrated, do not proceed.
The *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* SHOULD be treated as *well-formed.*
. Does the _<<_identity_assertion_consumer,identity assertion consumer>>_ trust the _<<_named_actor,named actor’s>> credential issuer_ to issue valid credentials?
.. Is there a direct trust relationship with the _<<_named_actor,named actor’s>> credential issuer?_
If so, proceed to step 3.
.. Is there a transitive trust relationship with the _<<_named_actor,named actor’s>> credential issuer_ via its _credential issuer?_
(In other words, does the _<<_identity_assertion_consumer,identity assertion consumer>>_ trust the _<<named_actor,named actor’s>> credential issuer_ to issue valid credentials?)
If so, proceed to step 3.
.. If neither relationship can be demonstrated, do not proceed.
The *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* SHOULD be treated as *well-formed.*
. Was the _<<_named_actor,named actor’s>>_ credential _<<_credential_revocation,revoked>>_ at the time the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* was signed?
.. If so, the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* SHOULD be treated as *revoked.*
.. If no such _<<_credential_revocation,revocation>>_ has been issued, the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* SHOULD be treated as *trusted.*

IMPORTANT: Any available information about _<<_credential_revocation,credential revocation>>_ SHOULD be included in the _<<_identity_assertion_consumer,identity assertion consumer’s>>_ report about the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* regardless of *trusted* or *untrusted* status.
