== Credentials, signatures, and validation methods

The *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* allows multiple signature types to be represented, although only one _<<ToIP verifiable identifier>>_ and corresponding signature can be used in any single assertion.

The signature type is represented by the `signer_payload.sig_type` field. Some credential types are described in this specification. It is strongly recommended that *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* validators be prepared to read all of the signature types described in this specification.

Other specifications MAY define additional `signer_payload.sig_type` values and the corresponding definition of `signature`, subject to restrictions described in xref:_labels[xrefstyle=full].

[IMPORTANT]
.Credential types in minor version updates
====
Future minor version updates (1.1, 1.2, etc.) to this specification MAY:

1. Add new sections to this specification defining new credential types and their corresponding `signer_payload.sig_type` values.
2. Mark existing sections of this specification defining existing credential types and their corresponding `signer_payload.sig_type` values as deprecated.

Such updates to the specification SHOULD continue to use the `cawg.identity` assertion label.
