=== Status codes

The set of standard success and failure codes for *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* validations are defined below.
These follow the format defined by the section titled link:++https://spec.c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.3/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_returning_validation_results++[Section 15.2, Returning validation results,”] of the C2PA technical specification.

The `url` field for a status code MUST always be the label of the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>.*
It is omitted from the tables below.

:note-caption: To Do
NOTE: We'll need new failure codes to capture the case where a credential without a C2PAAssetBinding fails validation.
e.g. something like cawg.identity.binding_enclosure_missing.
Perhaps this will live in the definition of the new assertion types instead though (as mentioned in the Note at the end of this section)

==== Success codes

[width="100%",cols="4,10",options="header"]
|=======================
| Value
| Meaning

| `cawg.identity.trusted`
| The *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>,* including the referenced credentials and signature binding the _<<_credential_holder,credential holder>>_ to the _<<C2PA claim>>_, is validated.
The _<<_named_actor,named actor>>_ is considered *trusted* according to the evaluation in xref:_trust_scenarios_in_identity_assertion[xrefstyle=full].

| `cawg.identity.well-formed`
| The *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>,* including the referenced credentials and signature binding the _<<_credential_holder,credential holder>>_ to the _<<C2PA claim>>_, is validated.
The evaluation in xref:_trust_scenarios_in_identity_assertion[xrefstyle=full] could not identify any root of trust for the _<<_named_actor,named actor>>._

|=======================

==== Failure codes

[width="100%",cols="4,10",options="header"]
|=======================

| Value
| Meaning

| `cawg.identity.cbor.invalid`
| The CBOR of the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* is not valid.

| `cawg.identity.assertion.mismatch`
| The *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* contains an assertion reference that could not be found in the _<<C2PA claim>>_ or any ingredient’s claim.

| `cawg.identity.assertion.duplicate`
| The *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* contains one or more duplicate assertion references.

| `cawg.identity.credential_revoked`
| The *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* was signed using a _<<_credential_revocation,revoked credential>>._

| `cawg.identity.hard_binding_missing`
| The *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* does not reference a _<<_hard_binding,hard binding>>_ assertion.

| `cawg.identity.hard_binding_incorrect`
| The *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* does not reference the correct _<<_hard_binding,hard binding>>_ assertion.

| `cawg.identity.sig_type.unknown`
| The `signer_payload.sig_type` of the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* is not recognized.

| `cawg.identity.pad.invalid`
| The `pad1` or `pad2` field contains non-zero bytes.

| `cawg.identity.expected_partial_claim.mismatch`
| The `signer_payload.expected_partial_claim` field did not match the _<<C2PA claim>>_ data structure.

| `cawg.identity.expected_claim_generator.mismatch`
| The `signer_payload.expected_claim_generator` field did not match the X.509 certificate used to sign the _<<C2PA claim>>._

| `cawg.identity.unexpected_countersigner`
| An *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* exists in this _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ that was not described in `signer_payload.expected_countersigners`.

| `cawg.identity.expected_countersigner.mismatch`
| An *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* exists in this _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ that has the expected `signer_payload` but has different signing credentials than were described in `signer_payload.expected_countersigners`.

| `cawg.identity.expected_countersigner.missing`
| The `signer_payload.expected_countersigners` describes an *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* that does not exist in this _<<C2PA Manifest>>._
