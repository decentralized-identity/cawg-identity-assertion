==== Validating an identity assertion with an identity claims aggregation credential

If the value of `signer_payload.sig_type` is `cawg.identity_claims_aggregation`, the validator SHOULD proceed with validation of the `signature` value as described in the remainder of this section.

A successful validation report SHOULD include the content of the verifiable credential and available information about the credential’s issuer.

===== Prerequisites

A validator shall maintain the following lists for identity claims aggregation credential issuers:

* A list of direct issuers of identity claims aggregation that the validator considers trusted.
* A list of trust anchors (issuers of identity claims aggregator credentials) that the validator considers trusted.

IMPORTANT: As of this writing, the Creator Assertions Working Group has not provided guidance about which identity claims aggregators to consider trusted.

===== W3C verifiable credentials verification

The raw content of the `signature` value is expected to be a `COSE_Sign1` data structure as described in xref:_verifiable_credential_proof_mechanism[xrefstyle=full].
The validator SHALL follow the steps outlined in the following subsections in the order presented.

====== Parse the `COSE_Sign1` structure

The validator SHALL parse the full `signature` value as a `COSE_Sign1` object as described in link:++https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9052.html#name-signing-with-one-signer++[Section 4.2, “Signing with one signer,”] of RFC 9052.
If parsing fails, the validator MUST stop validation at this point and issue the failure code `cawg.ica.invalid_cose_sign1`.

The validator SHALL inspect the `COSE_Sign1` protected header `alg` to determine the cryptographic algorithm used to issue the signature.
The `alg` value MUST be one of the following algorithm labels (corresponding to the values supported by the C2PA technical specification as of this writing):

* -7 (ECDSA w/SHA-256)
* -35 (ECDSA w/ SHA-384)
* -36 (ECDSA w/ SHA-512)
* -37 (RSASSA-PSS w/ SHA-256)
* -38 (RSASSA-PSS w/ SHA-384)
* -39 (RSASSA-PSS w/ SHA-512)
* -8 (EdDSA)

NOTE: Only the Ed25519 instance of EdDSA is supported.

If the `alg` header contains any other value or is not present, the validator MUST issue the failure code `cawg.ica.invalid_alg` but MAY continue validation.

The validator SHALL inspect the `COSE_Sign1` protected header `content type` to determine the content type of the enclosed credential.
The `content type` header MUST be the exact value `application/vc`.
If it is not, the validator MUST issue the failure code `cawg.ica.invalid_content_type` but MAY continue validation.

====== Parse the verifiable credential

The validator SHALL obtain the unprotected `payload` of the `COSE_Sign1` data structure.
This payload is the raw JSON-LD content of the verifiable credential.
A validator SHALL attempt to parse the core verifiable credential data syntax of this credential using the following methods:

* link:++https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#syntaxes++[Section 6, “Syntaxes,” of Verifiable credentials data model, version 1.1]
* link:++https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#syntaxes++[Section 6, “Syntaxes,” of Verifiable credentials data model, version 2.0]

If the validator is unable to parse the credential using either version of the Verifiable credentials data model, the validator MUST stop validation at this point and issue the failure code `cawg.ica.invalid_verifiable_credential`.

NOTE: This specification defines a series of success and failure codes that align with the C2PA technical specification.
A validator MAY also provide supplementary information to its client, such as “problem details” as defined in link:++https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#verification++[Section 7.1, “Validation,”] of the W3C verifiable credentials data model specification.

====== Obtain the credential issuer’s public key

The validator SHALL obtain the identity of the identity claims aggregator by inspecting the `issuer` field of the verifiable credential.
The identity SHOULD be expressed as a DID (link:https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/[decentralized identifier]), either as `issuer` itself or `issuer.id`.
If no DID is located at either location, the validator MUST issue the failure code `cawg.ica.invalid_issuer` but MAY continue validation.

The validator SHALL resolve the DID document as described in link:++https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/#did-resolution++[Section 7.1, “DID resolution,”] of the DID specification.
If the DID uses a DID method that is unsupported by the validator, the validator MUST issue the failure code `cawg.ica.did_unsupported_method` but MAY continue validation.
If the DID can not be resolved, the validator MUST issue the failure code `cawg.ica.did_unavailable` but MAY continue validation.

The validator SHALL parse the DID document and locate within the DID document the `assertionMethod` verification method as described in link:++https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/#assertion++[Section 5.3.2, “Assertion,”] of the DID specification.
This verification method SHALL contain public key material corresponding to the stated issuer.
If the DID document can not be parsed or the public key material can not be located, the validator MUST issue the failure code `cawg.ica.invalid_did_document` but MAY continue validation.

The validator SHALL verify that the `type` code for this public key is on the supported list of DID verification methods as described in xref:_did_verification_methods[xrefstyle=full].
If the type is not supported, the validator MUST issue the failure code `cawg.ica.invalid_did_document` but MAY continue validation.

The validator SHALL verify that the issuer’s DID is present or can be traced to its preconfigured list of trustable entities.
If the issuer is not verifiably trusted, the validator MUST issue the failure code `cawg.ica.untrusted_issuer` but MAY continue validation.

====== Verify the COSE signature

The validator SHALL verify the signature using the public key material just identified and the unsecured verifiable credential as payload as described by link:++https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9052#section-4.4++[Section 4.4, “Signing and verification process,”] of RFC 9052.
If the signature does not match, the validator MUST issue the failure code `cawg.ica.signature_mismatch` but MAY continue validation.

====== Verify the time stamp, if present

The validator SHALL inspect the time stamp included in the `COSE_Sign1` data structure if it is present.
This will be stored in a COSE unprotected header named `sigTst2`.
If such a header is found, the validator SHALL follow the procedure described in link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_time_stamps++[Section 10.3.2.5, “Time-stamps,”] of the C2PA technical specification.
If the validation is successful, the validator MUST issue the success code `cawg.ica.time_stamp.validated`.
If the validation is not successful, the validator MUST issue the status code `cawg.ica.time_stamp.invalid`.
It MAY continue validation, but MUST NOT use the time stamp in any further validation calculation.

IMPORTANT: C2PA “version 1” time stamps are not supported when used in *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertions>>.*
A validator SHOULD ignore any value found in a `sigTst` unprotected header.

====== Verify the credential’s validity range

The validator SHALL inspect the credential's effective date.
This may be stored as `issuanceDate` or `validFrom`, depending on the version of the verifiable credentials data model in use.
If this field is missing, the validator MUST issue the failure code `cawg.ica.valid_from.missing` but MAY continue validation.

The validator SHALL compare the effective date of the credential against each of the following values, if available:

* Current date and time
* Time stamp for the C2PA Manifest as described in link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_time_stamps++[Section 10.3.2.5, “Time-stamps,”] of the C2PA technical specification
* Time stamp for the COSE signature as described in xref:_verifiable_credential_proof_mechanism[xrefstyle=full]

If the credential’s effective date is later than any of the above values, the validator MUST issue the failure code `cawg.ica.valid_from.invalid` but MAY continue validation.

If the credential contains an expiration date, the validator SHALL inspect that date.
This may be stored as `expirationDate` or `validUntil`, depending on the version of the verifiable credentials data model in use.
If this field is missing, the validator SHALL proceed without issuing any status code.

If the expiration date is present, the validator SHALL compare the expiration date of the credential against each of the following values, if available:

* Current date and time
* Time stamp for the C2PA Manifest as described in link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_time_stamps++[Section 10.3.2.5, “Time-stamps,”] of the C2PA technical specification
* Time stamp for the COSE signature as described in xref:_verifiable_credential_proof_mechanism[xrefstyle=full]

If the credential’s expiration date is earlier than any of the above values, the validator MUST issue the failure code `cawg.ica.valid_until.invalid` but MAY continue validation.

====== Verify the credential’s revocation status

If the credential contains a `credentialStatus` entry, the validator SHALL inspect the contents of that entry.
If the entry contains an entry with its `statusPurpose` set to `revocation`, the validator SHALL follow the procedures described as described by the corresponding `type` entry.

If the `credentialStatus` entry is present but does not contain a revocation list supported by the validator, the validator MAY continue validation and SHOULD issue the failure code `cawg.ica.revocation.unsupported`.

If the `credentialStatus` entry contains a revocation list that is supported by the validator but is inaccessible (e.g. due to network connection issues), the validator MAY continue validation and SHOULD issue the failure code `cawg.ica.revocation.unavailable`.

If the validator is able to complete the revocation status check, it should respond as follows:

* If the status check indicates that the credential has not been revoked, the validator SHOULD continue validation and SHOULD issue the success code `cawg.ica.credential.not_revoked`.
* If the status check indicates that the credential has been revoked, the validator SHOULD NOT continue validation and MUST issue the failure code `cawg.ica.credential.revoked`.

NOTE: This specification recommends that issuers and validators support the `BitstringStatusListEntry` type as defined by the link:https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-bitstring-status-list/[Bitstring status list] specification (in 1.0 draft status as of this writing).

====== Verify the credential’s schema

The requirements for identity claims aggregation credentials are summarized in a link:https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-json-schema/[verifiable credentials JSON schema] available at `https://cawg.io/identity/1.1/ica/schema/`.
It is RECOMMENDED that verifiers use the `credentialSchema` to validate the structure and data integrity of the verifiable credential.

NOTE: The schema document makes use of the `format` JSON Schema keyword.
If used, the JSON Schema processor must enable the `format` usage.

===== Verify binding to C2PA asset

The validator SHALL take the content of `signer_payload` in the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* and perform the transformations from CBOR to JSON as described in xref:_binding_to_c2pa_asset[xrefstyle=full].
The validator SHALL then compare the transformed `signer_payload` data structure to the `c2paAsset` field contained within the verifiable credential’s `credentialSubject` field.
If the data structures do not match, the validator MUST issue the failure code `cawg.ica.signer_payload.mismatch` but MAY continue validation.

===== Verify verified identities

The validator SHALL inspect the contents of the `verifiedIdentities` field contained within the verifiable credential’s `credentialSubject` field.
If this field is missing, if it is not a JSON array, or if it is an empty array, the validator MUST issue the failure code `cawg.ica.verified_identities.missing` but MAY continue validation.

The validator SHALL inspect each entry in the `verifiedIdentities` array.
For each entry, it SHALL verify each of the conditions stated in xref:#vc-credentialsubject-verifiedIdentities[xrefstyle=full] and issue the failure code `cawg.ica.verified_identities.invalid` if any condition stated there is unmet.

The validator MAY annotate entries in the `verifiedIdentities` array according to its own policies regarding trust or validity of each identity.

NOTE: The C2PA validation status mechanism does not currently define a mechanism for signaling _which_ entry within a given assertion is the cause for a validation status entry.
For that reason, it is RECOMMENDED that the validator provide an out-of-band signal which identifies which of the entries in `verifiedIdentities` is not accepted.

===== Success code

If the validator has completed the process without generating any failure codes, it MUST issue the success code `cawg.ica.credential_valid` for this assertion.
