==== Identity claims aggregation technical description

The _<<_identity_claims_aggregator,identity claims aggregator>>_ will produce a specific type of _<<_W3C verifiable credential,W3C verifiable credential>>_ called an “identity claims aggregation” that binds the identity attestation claims to the _<<C2PA asset>>._ This credential, once signed with the _<<_identity_claims_aggregator,identity claims aggregator’s>>_ private key, is the `signature` value for the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>.* The signature value is further described in xref:_verifiable_credential_proof_mechanism[xrefstyle=full].

The `signer_payload.sig_type` value for such an assertion MUST be `cawg.identity_claims_aggregation`.

The trust model in this scenario is as described in xref:_named_actor_without_signature_authority[xrefstyle=full].

An *identity claims aggregation* MUST meet all requirements for a verifiable credential as described in the W3C Verifiable credentials data model (either https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/[version 1.1] or https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/[version 2.0]) and additional requirements as stated in the remainder of this section.

[#vc-property-context]
===== Context

The `@context` property MUST be present and MUST contain at least the following two entries:

* `https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1` _or_ `https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2`, depending on which version of the W3C verifiable credentials data model is being used
* `https://cawg.io/identity/1.1/ica/context/`

[#vc-property-type]
===== Type

The `type` property MUST be present and MUST contain at least the following two entries:

* `VerifiableCredential`
* `IdentityClaimsAggregationCredential`

[#vc-property-issuer]
===== Issuer

The `issuer` property MUST be present and MUST follow the format as specified in link:++https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#issuer++[Section 4.5, “Issuer,”] of the Verifiable credentials data model.

[#vc-property-validFrom]
===== Validity

If using https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/[Verifiable credentials data model, version 1.1], the `issuanceDate` field MUST exist and it MUST express the date and time when the credential becomes valid, as specified in link:++https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#issuance-date++[Section 4.6, “Issuance date,”] of the Verifiable credentials data model.

If using https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/[Verifiable credentials data model, version 2.0], the `validFrom` field MUST exist and it MUST express the date and time when the credential becomes valid, as specified in link:++https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#validity-period++[Section 4.8, “Validity period,”] of the Verifiable credentials data model.

[#vc-credentialsubject-verifiedIdentities]
===== Verified identities

The `verifiedIdentities` property MUST be present and MUST be a non-empty array. Every item in the array MUST contain information about the _<<_named_actor,named actor>>_ as verified by the _<<_identity_assertion_generator,identity assertion generator>>_ or a service contacted by the _<<_identity_assertion_generator,identity assertion generator>>._

[#vc-credentialsubject-verifiedidentity-name]
====== Display name

The `verifiedIdentities[?].name` property MAY be present. If present, it MUST NOT be empty and must be a string defining the _<<_named_actor,named actor’s>>_ name as understood by the _<<_identity_provider,identity provider>>._

|=======================

Other string values MAY be used in `verifiedIdentities[?].method`, subject to restrictions described in xref:_labels[xrefstyle=full].

The examples provided here are non-normative, but are intended to demonstrate the kind of procedures described by each method type.

[#vc-credentialsubject-verifiedidentity-verifiedat]
====== Identity verification date

The `verifiedIdentities[?].verifiedAt` MUST be present and MUST be a valid date-time as specified by link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339[RFC 3339]. It represents the earlier of the following:

* The date and time when the relationship between the _<<_named_actor,named actor>>_ and the _<<_identity_provider,identity provider>>_ was verified by the _<<_identity_assertion_generator,identity assertion generator>>._
* In the case where the _<<_named_actor,named actor’s>>_ identity was verified by a third party (for example, for document verification), the date and time at which the _<<_named_actor,named actor’s>>_ identity was verified by the third party.

[#vc-credentialsubject-verifiedidentity-provider]
====== Identity provider details

The `verifiedIdentities[?].provider` property MUST be an object and MUST be present. It contains details about the _<<_identity_provider,identity provider>>_ and the identity verification process. This specification mentions at least two properties that MAY be used to represent the _<<_named_actor,named actor’s>>_ verification details: `id` and `name`.

[#vc-credentialsubject-verifiedidentity-provider-id]
Identity provider ID::
The `verifiedIdentities[?].provider.id` SHOULD be present. If present, it MUST be a valid URI that contains information about the _<<_identity_provider,identity provider>>._ This SHOULD NOT be confused with any information about the _<<_named_actor,named actor>>_ itself. It is RECOMMENDED that this resolve to a xref:_w3c_decentralized_identifier_document[xrefstyle=full] if one is available.

[#vc-credentialsubject-verifiedidentity-provider-name]
Identity provider name::
The `verifiedIdentities[?].provider.name` MUST be present and MUST be a _<<_natural_language_string,natural language string>>._ The `verifiedIdentities[?].provider.name` property is the name of the _<<_identity_provider,identity provider>>._

===== Binding to C2PA asset

The `credentialSubject` field MUST contain a `c2paAsset` entry, which MUST be the JSON serialization of the `signer_payload` data structure presented for signature with the following adaptations:

* All CBOR bytestring values in `signer_payload` data structure (for example, `hash` entries in the hashlink data structure) MUST be converted to the corresponding base 64 encoding as specified in link:++https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-4++[Section 4, “Base 64 Encoding,”] of RFC 4648. The base 64 encoding MUST NOT use the URL-safe variation of base 64. The encoding MUST NOT include line feeds or additional annotations not directly required by the core base 64 specification.
* The JSON encoding MUST use the field names exactly as specified in xref:_overview[xrefstyle=full].
+
IMPORTANT: Field names in the `signer_payload` data structure (see xref:_overview[xrefstyle=full]) are specified using lower-case letters with underscore characters (commonly referred to as `snake_case`). Field names in the verifiable credential data model are typically specified using lower-case letters with upper-case letters for word breaks (commonly referred to as `camelCase`). A translation between the two styles MUST NOT be performed as it creates the potential for miscommunication.

===== Credential status (revocation)

An _<<_identity_claims_aggregator,identity claims aggregator>>_ SHOULD allow for an *<<_identity_claims_aggregation,identity claims aggregation>>* claim to be revoked by adding a `credentialStatus` section to the credential as described in link:++https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#status++[§4.9, Status], of the Verifiable credentials data model, and subject to the following recommendations:

* At least one entry SHOULD have its `statusPurpose` field set to `revocation`.
* Status list credentials SHOULD be expressed using a link:https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-bitstring-status-list/[W3C bitstring status list], version 1.0 or later. Other mechanisms SHOULD NOT be used because _<<_identity_assertion_consumer,identity assertion consumers>>_ may not be prepared to correctly interpret such status lists.

[#vc-schema]
===== Schema

The requirements for identity claims aggregation credentials are summarized in a link:https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-json-schema/[verifiable credentials JSON schema] available at `https://cawg.io/identity/1.1/ica/schema/`. The inclusion of the `credentialSchema` property is RECOMMENDED (as shown in the example below) to specify the structure and constraints of the credential’s data.
