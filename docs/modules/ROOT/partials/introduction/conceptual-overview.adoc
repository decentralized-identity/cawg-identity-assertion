=== Conceptual overview

Each *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* instance allows exactly one _<<_credential_holder,credential holder>>_ to sign a data structure known as `signer_payload`, which among other things includes a list of _<<_c2pa_assertion,C2PA assertions>>_ which will subsequently be included in a _<<C2PA Manifest>>._

The _<<_credential_holder,credential holder’s>>_ signature should generally be construed as reflective of the _<<_named_actor,named actor’s>>_ authorization of or active participation in the production of the the _<<C2PA asset>>_ in which it appears, as described by the specific _<<_c2pa_assertion,C2PA assertions>>_ that are referenced in the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>.*

Each *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* contains a `signer_payload` with hashlink references to one or more other _<<_c2pa_assertion,C2PA assertions>>,_ known here as _<<_referenced_assertions,referenced assertions>>,_ and a signature from the _<<_credential_holder,credential holder>>_ over that payload, thus providing a non-repudiable, tamper-evident binding between the _<<_named_actor,named actor>>_ and the list of _<<_referenced_assertions,referenced assertions>>._

The `signer_payload` and corresponding signature from the _<<_credential_holder,credential holder>>_ binds this identity assertion to a specific _<<C2PA asset>>_ and allows the _<<_credential_holder,credential holder>>_ to endorse or make additional statements about the _<<_named_actor,named actor’s>>_ relationship to that _<<C2PA asset>>._

The *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* should be thought of as a trust signal that is independent from (and thus, in _addition_ to) the trust signal provided by the _<<C2PA claim generator>>_ itself.

.Trust signal scope with one identity assertion

====
The diagram that follows, with one _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ containing one *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>,* is intended to illustrate the most basic example of the two trust signals available and how they intersect:

.Overview of identity assertion
image::overview/single-ia-trust-bubbles.drawio.svg[Single identity assertion trust example,width=240,height=400,align="center"]

In this notation, the small blue circles (A1, A2, etc.) are intended to represent any assertion other than an *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* or _<<_hard_binding,hard binding>>_ assertion.
(As examples, any of these could represent an actions assertion, a metadata assertion, or a thumbnail assertion.)
The black circle (HB) is used to represent the _<<_hard_binding,hard binding>>_ assertion, which is a required part of a valid _<<C2PA Manifest>>._
The yellow circle demonstrates the limit of *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion 1’s>>* trust signal.
The teal circle demonstrates the limit of the _<<_c2pa_manifest,C2PA Manifest’s>>_ trust signal.

The following diagram shows *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion 1>>* using the _<<_credential_holder,credential holder’s>>_ signature to seal:

* assertions A1 and A2,
* the portion of the asset that does not include the _<<C2PA Manifest Store>>_ (via HB), and
* any other information in `signer_payload`.

.Identity assertion structure
image::overview/identity-assertion-structure.drawio.svg[Trust model for identity assertion,width=490,height=430,align="center"]

The following diagram shows the _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ using the _<<_claim_generator,claim generator’s>>_ signature to seal:

* assertions A1, A2, and A3,
* identity assertion 1,
* the portion of the asset that does not include the _<<C2PA Manifest Store>>_ (via HB), and
* any other information in the claim data structure.

The *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* may be repeated any number of times to convey information specific to distinct _<<_named-actor,named actors>>._

[#trust-signal-scope-two-ias]
.Trust signal scope with two non-overlapping identity assertions
[example]
====
The diagram that follows extends xref:trust-signal-scope-one-ia[xrefstyle=full], by showing how two *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertions>>* could be used to describe distinct assertions attested to by two distinct _<<_named_actor,named actors>>:_

.Two non-overlapping identity assertions
image::overview/non-overlapping-trust-bubbles.drawio.svg[Two non-overlapping identity assertions example,width=400,height=400,align="center"]

In this example, *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion 1>>* is using its _<<_credential_holder,credential holder’s>>_ signature to seal:

* assertions A1 and A2,
* the portion of the asset that does not include the _<<C2PA Manifest Store>>_ (via HB), and
* any other information in its `signer_payload`.

The yellow circle demonstrates the limit of *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion 1’s>>* trust signal.

In this example, *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion 2>>* is using its _<<_credential_holder,credential holder’s>>_ signature to seal:

* assertions A3, A4, and A5,
* the portion of the asset that does not include the _<<C2PA Manifest Store>>_ (via HB), and
* any other information in its `signer_payload`.

The dark blue circle demonstrates the limit of *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion 2’s>>* trust signal.

Separately, the _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ uses the _<<_claim_generator,claim generator’s>>_ signature to seal:

* assertions A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, and A6,
* identity assertion 1,
* identity assertion 2,
* the portion of the asset that does not include the _<<C2PA Manifest Store>>_ (via HB), and
* any other information in the claim data structure.

The teal circle demonstrates the limit of the _<<_c2pa_manifest,C2PA Manifest’s>>_ trust signal.
====

An *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* may reference one or more other *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertions>>.*
As an example, this might be used to convey an organizational endorsement of an individual creator’s credential.

[#trust-signal-scope-nested-ias]
.Trust signal scope with nested identity assertions
[example]
====
The diagram that follows modifies xref:trust-signal-scope-two-ias[xrefstyle=full], by showing how one *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* could be used to attest to the validity of another *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>:*

.Nested identity assertions
image::overview/nested-trust-bubbles.drawio.svg[Nested identity assertions example,width=400,height=400,align="center"]

In this example, *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion 1>>* is using its _<<_credential_holder,credential holder’s>>_ signature to seal:

* assertions A1 and A2,
* the portion of the asset that does not include the _<<C2PA Manifest Store>>_ (via HB), and
* any other information in its `signer_payload`.

The yellow circle demonstrates the limit of *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion 1’s>>* trust signal.

In this example, *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion 2>>* is using its _<<_credential_holder,credential holder’s>>_ signature to seal:

* assertions A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5,
* identity assertion 1,
* the portion of the asset that does not include the _<<C2PA Manifest Store>>_ (via HB), and
* any other information in its `signer_payload`.

The dark blue circle demonstrates the limit of *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion 2’s>>* trust signal, which completely overlaps the limit of *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion 1’s>>* trust signal.

Separately, the _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ uses the _<<_claim_generator,claim generator’s>>_ signature to seal:

* assertions A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, and A6,
* identity assertion 1,
* identity assertion 2,
* the portion of the asset that does not include the _<<C2PA Manifest Store>>_ (via HB), and
* any other information in the claim data structure.

The teal circle demonstrates the limit of the _<<_c2pa_manifest,C2PA Manifest’s>>_ trust signal.
