The link:https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html[*C2PA technical specification*] allows _<<_actor,actors>>_ in a workflow to make cryptographically signed _<<_c2pa_assertion,assertions>>_ about the produced _<<C2PA asset>>._ This signature is issued by the vendor whose software or hardware was used to create the _<<_c2pa_assertion,C2PA assertions>>_ and the _<<C2PA claim>>,_ which is why it is called the _<<C2PA claim generator>>._

This specification describes a _<<C2PA assertion>>_ referred to here as the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* that can be added to a _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ to enable a _<<_credential_holder,credential holder>>_ to prove control over a digital identity and to use that identity to document the _<<_named_actor,named actor’s>>_ role(s) in the _<<C2PA asset>>’s_ lifecycle.
