=== X.509 certificates and COSE signatures

In some use cases, an _<<_actor,actor>>_ in the system MAY wish to provide an _https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280[X.509 certificate]_ to have an organizational or individual identity described by the certificate associated with the list of _<<_referenced_assertions,referenced assertions>>._

The `signer_payload.sig_type` value for such an assertion MUST be `cawg.x509.cose`.
The `signature` value MUST be a _https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8152[COSE signature]_ as described below.

==== Generating the COSE signature

To generate the COSE signature for an *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>,* the steps described in the listed sections of the C2PA technical specification MUST be followed with adaptations as described subsequently:

* link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_signing_a_claim++[Section 10.3.2.4, “Signing a claim”]
* link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_time_stamps++[Section 10.3.2.5, “Time-stamps”]
+
IMPORTANT: An *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* MUST NOT contain a v1 time-stamp as defined in link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_choosing_the_payload++[Section 10.3.2.5.2, “Choosing the payload.”]
* link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_credential_revocation_information++[Section 10.3.2.6, “Credential revocation information”]
* link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_hashing++[Section 13.1, “Hashing”]
* link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_digital_signatures++[Section 13.2, “Digital signatures”]

In each of the above sections, the following changes MUST be applied:

* Any reference to the _claim_ MUST be replaced with the CBOR serialization of the `signer_payload` field from the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>.*
The `signer_payload` data structure MUST be serialized as described in link:++https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949.html#name-core-deterministic-encoding++[Section 4.2.1, “Core Deterministic Encoding,”] of RFC 8949: Concise Binary Object Representation.
The resulting byte string is presented to the _<<_credential_holder,credential holder>>_ for signature.
* Any reference to the _claim generator_ MUST be replaced with the _<<_actor,actor>>_ whose _X.509 certificate_ is being used for this assertion.

==== Validating the COSE signature

To validate the COSE signature for an *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>,* the steps described in the listed sections of the C2PA technical specification MUST be followed with adaptations as described:

* link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_validate_the_signature++[Section 15.5, “Validate the signature.”] Disregard the paragraph that starts with “Retrieve the URI reference.”
Instead retrieve the COSE signature from the `signature` field of the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>.*
* link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_validate_the_time_stamp++[Section 15.6, “Validate the time-stamp”]
* link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_validate_the_credential_revocation_information++[Section 15.7, “Validate the credential revocation information”]

In each of the above sections, the following changes MUST be applied:

* Any reference to the _claim_ MUST be replaced with the CBOR serialization of the `signer_payload` field from the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>.*
* Any reference to the _claim generator_ MUST be replaced with the _<<_actor,actor>>_ whose _X.509 certificate_ is being used for this assertion.
* The validator SHALL maintain one or more _<<_trust_list,trust lists>>_ which do not need to be the same as the _<<_trust_list,trust lists>>_ used to validate claim generator signatures as described in link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_c2pa_signers++[Section 14.4.1, “C2PA Signers.”]
* The validator SHALL consider any v1 time-stamp as defined in link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_choosing_the_payload++[Section 10.3.2.5.2, “Choosing the payload”] to be invalid.
