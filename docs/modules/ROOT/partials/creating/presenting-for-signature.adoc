=== Presenting the `signer_payload` data structure for signature

Prior to presenting the _<<_credential_holder,credential holder>>_ with the `signer_payload` data structure for signature, any _<<_referenced_assertions,referenced assertions>>_ that are in the same _<<C2PA claim>>_ as the *<<_identity_assertion, identity assertion>>* MUST themselves be created.
This process is described in link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_creating_assertions++[Section 10.3.1, “Creating assertions,”] of the C2PA technical specification.

The list of _<<_referenced_assertions,referenced assertions>>_ MUST include a _<<_hard_binding,hard binding>>_ assertion that describes the active manifest using the process described in the opening paragraph of link:++https://spec.c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_validate_the_assets_content++[Section 15.12, “Validate the asset’s content,”] of the C2PA technical specification.

The list of _<<_referenced_assertions,referenced assertions>>_ SHOULD include any _<<_c2pa_assertion,assertions>>_ necessary to allow the _<<_actor,actor>>_ to accurately describe their relationship to the content.
For example, a `c2pa.actions` assertion could be referenced to attest that the _<<_actor,actor>>_ performed those specific actions.

The `signer_payload` data structure MUST be presented to be signed by the _<<_credential_holder,credential holder>>_ corresponding to each *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>.*
This process is described in more detail in xref:_credentials_signatures_and_validation_methods[xrefstyle=full].

IMPORTANT: If a data hash assertion is being used, the _<<_identity_assertion_generator,identity assertion generator>>_ MUST also follow the process described in xref:_interaction_with_data_hash_assertion[xrefstyle=full].

==== Calculating the `expected_partial_claim` field

If the _<<_identity_assertion_generator,identity assertion generator>>_ chooses to include the `expected_partial_claim` field in `signer_payload`, it MUST be computed as follows:

. Create a valid _<<C2PA claim>>_ data structure that includes references to all _<<_c2pa_assertion,C2PA assertions>>,_ *including* all *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertions>>.*
The `hash` value for all assertion references MUST be valid and correct, except in the following cases:
.. For the specific *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* being computed, replace the `hash` value with all zero-value (`0x00`) bytes.
.. For any *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertions>>* whose signing credentials are described via the `expected_countersigners` field, replace the `hash` value with all zero-value (`0x00`) bytes.
. Serialize the _<<C2PA claim>>_ data structure using link:++https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949.html#name-core-deterministic-encoding++[Section 4.2.1, “Core deterministic encoding,”] of RFC 8949: Concise binary object representation.
. Compute a hash of the serialized _<<C2PA claim>>_ data structure using one of the algorithms documented in link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_hashing++[Section 13.1, “Hashing,”] of the C2PA technical specification.

The `expected_partial_claim` field SHOULD contain a CBOR map with the following fields:

* `alg` describing the hash algorithm as described in link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_hashing++[Section 13.1, “Hashing,”] of the C2PA technical specification, and
* `hash` value containing the computed hash of the serialized _<<C2PA claim>>_ data structure.

==== Calculating the `expected_claim_generator` field

If the _<<_identity_assertion_generator,identity assertion generator>>_ chooses to include the `expected_claim_generator` field in `signer_payload`, it MUST be computed as follows:

. Identify the end-entity signing certificate that will be used for the expected _<<C2PA claim generator>>._
. Serialize this signing certificate as a CBOR byte string as described in link:https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#x509_certificates[Section 14.6, “X.509 certificates,”] of the C2PA technical specification.
This serialization should be performed using link:++https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949.html#name-core-deterministic-encoding++[Section 4.2.1, “Core deterministic encoding,”] of RFC 8949: Concise binary object representation.
. Compute a hash of the serialized end-entity certificate using one of the algorithms documented in link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_hashing++[Section 13.1, “Hashing,”] of the C2PA technical specification.

The resulting hash should be used as the `expected_claim_generator` field.

The `expected_claim_generator` field SHOULD contain a CBOR map with the following fields:

* `alg` describing the hash algorithm as described in link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_hashing++[Section 13.1, “Hashing,”] of the C2PA technical specification, and
* `hash` value containing the computed hash of the serialized certificate.

==== Calculating the `expected_countersigners` field

If the _<<_identity_assertion_generator,identity assertion generator>>_ chooses to include the `expected_countersigners` field in `signer_payload`, it MUST be computed as follows:

. For every _other_ *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* that will be present in the _<<C2PA Manifest>>:_
.. Calculate the `signer_payload` map for that *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>.*
Exclude any `expected_countersigners` field from that `signer_payload` map and place the resulting `signer_payload` structure in the `partial_signer_payload` field of _this_ *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion’s>>* `expected_countersigners` map.
.. _(optional)_ Identify the signing credential that will be used to sign that *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>.*
... Serialize the signing credential as a CBOR byte string as described in xref:_serialization_for_credential_types[].
This serialization should be performed using link:++https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949.html#name-core-deterministic-encoding++[Section 4.2.1, “Core deterministic encoding,”] of RFC 8949: Concise binary object representation.
... Compute a hash of the serialized signing credential using one of the algorithms documented in link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_hashing++[Section 13.1, “Hashing,”] of the C2PA technical specification.
. Once the above materials have been gathered, the `expected_countersigners` field SHOULD contain a CBOR array of CBOR maps, each containing the following fields for each *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>*:
.. `partial_signer_payload` _(required)_ containing the expected `signer_payload`, omitting any `expected_countersigners` field.
.. `expected_credentials` _(optional)_ containing a description of the expected signing credentials:
... `alg` describing the hash algorithm as described in link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_hashing++[Section 13.1, “Hashing,”] of the C2PA technical specification, and
... `hash` value containing the computed hash of the serialized signing credential.

==== Serialization for credential types

The signing credential for other *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertions>>* should be serialized depending on the credential type:

[width="100%",cols="4,10",options="header"]

| Credential type | Serialization
| X.509 certificate | End-entity certificate
