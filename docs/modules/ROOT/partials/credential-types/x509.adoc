=== X.509 certificates and COSE signatures

In some use cases, an _<<_actor,actor>>_ in the system MAY wish to provide an _https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280[X.509 certificate]_ to have an organizational or individual identity described by the certificate associated with the list of _<<_referenced_assertions,referenced assertions>>._

The `signer_payload.sig_type` value for such an assertion MUST be `cawg.x509.cose`.
The `signature` value MUST be a _https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8152[COSE signature]_ as described below.

==== Generating the COSE signature

To generate the COSE signature for an *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>,* the steps described in the listed sections of the C2PA technical specification MUST be followed with adaptations as described subsequently:

* link:++https://spec.c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_signing_a_claim++[Section 10.3.2.4, “Signing a claim”]
* link:++https://spec.c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_time_stamps++[Section 10.3.2.5, “Time-stamps”]
+
IMPORTANT: An *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* MUST NOT contain a v1 time stamp as defined in link:++https://spec.c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_choosing_the_payload++[Section 10.3.2.5.2, “Choosing the payload.”]
+
An *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* generator MAY omit the time stamp from the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* if it expects that a valid time stamp will be added to the _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ or as a separate link:++https://spec.c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#time_stamp_manifests++[time-stamp manifest] or link:++https://spec.c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#timestamp_assertion++[time-stamp assertion].
* link:++https://spec.c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_credential_revocation_information++[Section 10.3.2.6, “Credential revocation information”]
* link:++https://spec.c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_hashing++[Section 13.1, “Hashing”]
* link:++https://spec.c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_digital_signatures++[Section 13.2, “Digital signatures”]

In each of the above sections, the following changes MUST be applied:

* Any reference to the _claim_ MUST be replaced with the CBOR serialization of the `signer_payload` field from the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>.*
The `signer_payload` data structure MUST be serialized as described in link:++https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949.html#name-core-deterministic-encoding++[Section 4.2.1, “Core Deterministic Encoding,”] of RFC 8949: Concise Binary Object Representation.
The resulting byte string is presented to the _<<_credential_holder,credential holder>>_ for signature.
* Any reference to the _claim generator_ MUST be replaced with the _<<_actor,actor>>_ whose _X.509 certificate_ is being used for this assertion.
* The *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* generator SHALL use an _X.509 certificate_ that complies with the trust model described in xref:_trust_model_for_x_509_certificates[xrefstyle=full].

==== Validating the COSE signature

To validate the COSE signature for an *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>,* the steps described in the listed sections of the C2PA technical specification MUST be followed with adaptations as described:

* link:++https://spec.c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_validate_the_signature++[Section 15.5, “Validate the signature.”] Disregard the paragraph that starts with “Retrieve the URI reference.”
Instead retrieve the COSE signature from the `signature` field of the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>.*
* link:++https://spec.c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_validate_the_time_stamp++[Section 15.6, “Validate the time-stamp”]
* link:++https://spec.c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_validate_the_credential_revocation_information++[Section 15.7, “Validate the credential revocation information”]

In each of the above sections, the following changes MUST be applied:

* Any reference to the _claim_ MUST be replaced with the CBOR serialization of the `signer_payload` field from the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>.*
* Any reference to the _claim generator_ MUST be replaced with the _<<_actor,actor>>_ whose _X.509 certificate_ is being used for this assertion.
* A validator MUST NOT issue the status `cawg.identity.trusted` for an *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* unless the _X.509 certificate_ is found to comply with the trust model as described in xref:_trust_model_for_x_509_certificates[xrefstyle=full].
* To determine the validity of an _X.509 certificate_ in an *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* signature, the validator MUST first consider any time stamp contained within the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>.* If no such time stamp exists, the validator MUST then evaluate the C2PA claim signature’s link:++https://spec.c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_time_stamps++[time stamp] or a subsequent link:++https://spec.c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#time_stamp_manifests++[time stamp manifest] or link:++https://spec.c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#timestamp_assertion++[time stamp assertion] to determine the time of signing.
* A validator SHALL consider any v1 time stamp as defined in link:++https://spec.c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_choosing_the_payload++[Section 10.3.2.5.2, “Choosing the payload”] to be invalid.


==== Trust model for X.509 certificates

A validator shall maintain the following information for evaluating CAWG X.509 signers, known as the *CAWG trust configuration*:

* A list of accepted Extended Key Usage (EKU) values. For each accepted EKU value,
** A list of accepted Certificate Policy (CP) values.
** A list of X.509 certificate trust anchors.

The list of accepted EKUs MUST include `id-kp-documentSigning` (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.36).
No certificate policy or trust anchors are required for `id-kp-documentSigning` at this time.

The requirements for link:++https://spec.c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_time_stamping_authorities++[Time stamping authorities] and link:++https://spec.c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_private_credential_storage++[Private credential storage] are identical to those stated in the C2PA technical standard.
An implementation MAY share the implementation for these two trust lists between C2PA and CAWG implementations.

====
The configuration options described in this section are valid only for *identity assertions* generated on or before 31 March 2027.
====

An *identity assertion* generator MUST include a valid time stamp in the <<C2PA Manifest>> or the **identity assertion** as described in xref:_generating_the_cose_signature[xrefstyle=full] to ensure validity under this section.

An *identity assertion* validator MUST evaluate the following conditions, regardless of time of validation.
